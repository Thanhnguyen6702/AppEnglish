                text("Borrowing VND1.5 billion (US$60,858) to quickly close the deal on a VND3.35 billion house in an alley in Hanoi instead of waiting was one of my best decisions.Whether to borrow money to buy a house or to wait and save up is a concern that many young families have.At the end of 2020, I had a monthly income of about VND80 million and managed to save around VND2 billion.Though house prices were much cheaper back then, they were still far beyond my financial capability.However, instead of continuing to save and wait, I decided to take out a VND1.5 billion loan from the bank with a 10-year term to buy a 40-square-meter house priced at VND3.35 billion. It has four floors and is built in a 3.5-meter wide alley in Hanoi.It has been over three years and the house has appreciated to VND5 billion while my debt has been mostly paid with only VND300 million remaining.However, it was not all smooth sailing. Right after the purchase, the Covid-19 pandemic broke out.Fortunately, I did not lose my job, but my salary was greatly reduced.I had to limit spending and avoid travelling or vacation. Life became a bit rough, but my family and I all made our best efforts to keep our jobs and maintain our lifestyle.Generally, buying a house with a loan will certainly come with pressure, but so far, my family and I have been living just fine after the decision to buy the house four years ago.For people like me, the amount of debt should not exceed VND1.8-2 billion and around VND200 - 300 million should be set aside for emergencies.With around VND4 billion, you can totally buy a house in inner-city districts like Ha Dong, Long Bien, Nam Tu Liem, and Bac Tu Liem with an area of about 30 square meters in small alleys under 2.5 meters wide.I have been living in Hanoi for nearly 50 years and I have noticed that through market cycle, the prices of apartments and townhouses in inner-city districts or densely populated residential areas have never decreased.In fact, the properties in these areas have increased as much as gold prices.Meanwhile, price declines usually occur in suburban and rural areas, where prices were previously inflated by speculation.With the housing supply being so limited in big cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City due to various legal hurdles, the prices of houses in the inner city will surely continue to rise.Therefore, if anyone has the chance, they should borrow and close the deal early as waiting might just cost you the opportunity to become a homeowner.What is everyone’s thought on this? Would you risk taking out a huge loan for a house?")

                text("My life has been much better after I escaped the elevator queue and the long walk to get to the car park that came with my previous apartment.Reading a story shared by reader Nghin NTT a few weeks ago, I cannot help but feel the urge to share my experience, which is quite the opposite of that reader.In his story, Nghin NTT sold his house in a tiny alley to move to an apartment because of the freedom and convenience it provides.Seeing how he described the 20-year-old house’s deteriorating state, I can totally understand his point.However, this perspective is usually only true for families with low income.In these cases, houses are mainly located in very small alleys and are poorly designed with little consideration for ventilation or sunlight.For relatively wealthy families living in modern areas or in villas with gardens in the middle of the city, surely no one would sell their house to move to an apartment, even if it is a premium one.Personally, I have been living in an apartment for 10 years, and I acknowledge that this type of housing has advantages such as security, cleanliness, good ventilation and the absence of pests.But there are also many limitations such as having to wait a long time for the elevator during peak hours, difficulty in carrying food or goods from the basement to the elevator and then up to my room, risks of damage and insufficient space to park your car because there are too many vehicles in the basement.Where I live, residents have to park their cars on the road near the curbs.This exposed the cars to sun and rain, which is very unsafe. I also have to park my car about 200 meters away from the apartment and walk home, which is truly inconvenient, especially when it rains.So, I decided to move to the outskirts to buy land and build a house. The plot of land I bought is only 120 square meters, but it is a corner block so I can design it as a garden house.Natural sunlight and fresh air permeate every nook and cranny of the house.The furniture I chose is all light-colored, so there are no mosquitoes even on the ground floor.Since escaping from my previous apartment, I truly feel happy.No more waiting for the elevator during peak hours, no more walking 200 meters to get my car, and the quality of my life has improved significantly.Now, even if I go to the supermarket and fill the trunk with goods, I do not have to worry about carrying heavy bags anymore because I can drive right up to the door.My clothes, bedding, and carpets always smell fresh because they are directly exposed to sunlight.The market, restaurants, and entertainment areas are only two or three kilometers away, so it is not a big obstacle for my family, especially since we have a car to move around.It is also easy to travel from my house to the city center. Another important thing is that I no longer feel anxious or worried whenever I hear news about a fire breaking out at an apartment building.In conclusion, there is no perfect type of housing. Apartments or houses each have their own advantages and disadvantages.I dare not assert that living in a house is always better than in an apartment because it depends on each person's living needs.If it feels suitable for you, then you should choose to live there for the long term. Do not blindly trust others' praises or criticisms only to end up shattered dreams.So do you prefer living in an apartment unit or a house?")

The yen fell to almost 150 per dollar, as investors took the BOJ's dovish guidance as a sign the interest rate differential between Japan and the United States likely will not narrow much.\n\nMarkets are now focusing on Governor Kazuo Ueda's post-meeting news conference for clues on the pace of further rate hikes.\n\nThe stakes are high. A spike in bond yields would boost the cost of funding Japan's huge public debt which, at twice the size of its economy, is the largest among advanced economies.\n\nAn end to the world's last remaining provider of cheap funds could also jolt global financial markets as Japanese investors, who amassed overseas investments in search of yields, shift money back to their home country.\n\nUnder previous Governor Kuroda, the BOJ deployed a huge asset-buying programme in 2013, originally aimed at firing up inflation to a 2% target within roughly two years.\n\nThe central bank introduced negative rates and YCC in 2016 as tepid inflation forced it to tweak its stimulus programme to a more sustainable one.\n\nAs the yen's sharp falls pushed up the cost of imports and heightened public criticism over the demerits of Japan's ultra-low interest rates, however, the BOJ last year tweaked YCC to relax its grip on long-term rates.")

                text("As Bank of Japan steps into currency markets for the first time in decades to defend a battered yen, it's facing many problems like its commitment to ultra-easy monetary settings.Thursday's sudden burst of yen-buying intervention by Japanese authorities -- the first instance since 1998 - caused a large 6 yen move between 140 and 146 in the dollar-yen exchange rate.At the end of the busy day, which also saw markets digest a hawkish Federal Reserve rate rise and a BOJ pledge to keep rates negative, investors were no less bearish on the yen, which has depreciated nearly 20% so far this year.\"It’s quite symbolic in the sense that this is the first time since 1998, but I don’t think that will be effective in reversing the trend of the yen,\" said Vincent Tsui, Asia analyst at Gavekal Research in Hong Kong.Given a history of deflation, the Bank of Japan's desire to keep rates low until it sees stable and healthy price rises has made it a lone dove this year as other major global central banks aggressively hike rates to contain surging inflation. U.S. policy rates are now 3 percentage points higher than Japan's.But the BOJ's policy is at odds even at home, with a government worried about the impact of a weak yen on energy prices and consumer sentiment, and its risk-loving households with idle cash reserves worth more than 1,000 trillion yen ($7.04 trillion) which are poised to hunt for better-yielding assets overseas.Governor Haruhiko Kuroda made clear that policy won't change, and even the yen the BOJ is buying as part of intervention will be replaced.\"As long as we are doing yield curve control, whatever monetary tightening effect (that comes from intervention) will be absorbed,\" he said on Thursday, referring to the BOJ’s consistent weekly bond-buying operations to cap yields.Brendan McKenna, international economist and currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities, points to how even as the intervention occurred, U.S. yields rose roughly 6 basis points on the day and Japanese yields fell, driving a bigger wedge in interest rates and giving markets even more reason to dump the yen.\"That the intervention has been unilateral and that it happened on the same day of a dovish Bank of Japan meeting speaks to the very large internal contradictions,\" Deutsche Bank's head of FX strategy George Saravelos said in a note.History shows...Saravelos says such intervention, while Japan sticks to a yield curve control policy, will result in a loss of credibility for the central bank, and might help reduce some speculative yen positions without really changing the trend.\"Intervention to strengthen the currency is at direct odds with Bank of Japan policy,\" Deutsche said, and that it was simply not credible for a central bank to be debasing its currency via extreme amounts of quantitative easing while authorities pursued a stronger currency at the same time.Citi analysts noted how the 1997-98 bout of yen-buying intervention failed to reverse its depreciation.Unlike now, yields then were wide apart but not moving against the yen while the boj intervened heavily between april and june 1998, the yen didn't trough until September.Still, it's early days. UBS strategist James Malcolm reckons the intervention may be a concerted campaign lasting many months, given how much speculative positioning there is against the yen and Japan's war chest of nearly $1.3 trillion in FX reserves.He points to Japan's lending to non-residents which hit a record high of $315 billion in the twelve months to July, and three-fourths of which was short-term, most of it built up since March.\"Intervention success is not measured in days but rather decades,\" Malcolm wrote, pointing to how Japanese authorities had last bought about 150 billion worth of dollars at close to 75 yen in 2011. Some of that is being spent now, he reckons.")

She boasts a large family lineage with up to 150 descendants spanning children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Ninh, Khong's daughter, is her primary caregiver.Despite her advanced age and limited mobility, Khong is described as being in a \"normal and healthy\" condition. Her daily diet consists of porridge and bird's nest drink. She often reminisces about her younger days, especially her times as a vendor supporting her seven children.Khong's significant milestones do not go unnoticed; she regularly receives visits and well-wishes from delegations at the provincial, city, and commune levels. For her 118th birthday in June 2023, local authorities presented her with a certificate of congratulations.Tang Quoc Lap, Vice Chairman of the People's Committee in Long Khanh Town where Khong resides, expressed hope that media attention would prompt the Guinness World Records to recognize Khong's longevity.")
